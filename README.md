Raigam Tele's 2017  Voting

This is posting due to non transparancy of raigam voting. They changing the winner as they want. 
Dont waste your money sending sms. This is a fraud


Issues in the Mobile APP which caused hacking

1. HTTP is used. It must use HTTPS with SSL pinning
2. Hard Coded Secret Key in the Codebase 
   private String SecretKey = "0123456789servin";
3. Code Obfuscation needs to be done


Mcrypt java class is taken from app code base
Run App.java to vote.

Hope Raigm will come up with a better voting app.
